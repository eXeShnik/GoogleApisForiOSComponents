# Overview

This repository is a community-supported continuation of the Xamarin Google/Firebase iOS binding libraries. Microsoft stopped updating the original `Xamarin.Firebase.iOS.*` and `Xamarin.Google.iOS.*` packages, so I maintain and publish compatible packages under these prefixes:

- `AdamE.Firebase.iOS.*`
- `AdamE.Google.iOS.*`
- `AdamE.MLKit.iOS.*`

The goal is to give .NET for iOS and Mac Catalyst developers a common binding baseline for Google, Firebase, and ML Kit native SDKs. That helps downstream libraries share the same native dependencies instead of each shipping incompatible copies of overlapping xcframeworks.

This repo contains the binding projects, Cake build automation, and documentation used to build and validate those packages.

## Firebase 12.6+ modernization notes

Starting with the Firebase `12.6.0` release, this project has been undergoing a Codex-assisted modernization wave. The goals are to make these binding packages easier to maintain, automate more of the native SDK upgrade process, detect and fix API drift across native version bumps, expand binding-focused E2E validation, improve documentation, and publish active Firebase products that were missing from the current package set.

That created a lot of repository churn around the `12.6.0` line. Much of that churn was tooling, validation, package metadata, documentation, and removal of stale repository content rather than changes to user-authored binding definitions. When binding definitions did change, it was usually for one of these reasons:

- an existing binding was proven to be broken at runtime, so current consumers could not reliably use that surface;
- a native API was missing from the managed binding, so the change was additive;
- missing enum values or native support enums were added;
- nullability was corrected to match the native Firebase headers;
- return or parameter types were corrected to match native declarations, such as native integer widths or protocol-typed return values.

Nullability updates are generally compile-time metadata changes, but they can surface new warnings in consumer code. Type corrections are more visible and can require source changes when the previous managed signature did not match the native SDK. In those cases, the pre-`12.6.0` binding was either stale, too broad, missing, or already capable of dispatching an invalid selector or marshaling the wrong native object.

dotnet tool run dotnet-cake -- --target=nuget --names=Google.SignIn
```

## Installation and usage notes

These packages target `net10.0-ios` and `net10.0-maccatalyst`. .NET 9 is no longer supported.

### `Firebase.Installations` may need an explicit reference

Some package combinations still work more reliably when `AdamE.Firebase.iOS.Installations` is referenced explicitly, even if it looks like it should be brought in transitively.

### Crashlytics is native crash reporting, not full .NET exception reporting

The underlying Crashlytics SDK does not understand managed .NET exceptions the same way it understands native crashes. Treat it as native crash reporting support, not a complete .NET error-reporting solution.

On .NET 8 iOS projects, set this property to avoid missing symbol/export issues:

```xml
<PropertyGroup Condition="$([MSBuild]::GetTargetPlatformIdentifier('$(TargetFramework)')) == 'ios'">
  <_ExportSymbolsExplicitly>false</_ExportSymbolsExplicitly>
</PropertyGroup>
```

### Condition package references for Apple targets only

If your project targets multiple platforms, keep these packages inside Apple-only `ItemGroup` conditions. Unconditional references in multi-targeted projects can lead to restore/build hangs.

```xml
<ItemGroup Condition="$([MSBuild]::GetTargetPlatformIdentifier('$(TargetFramework)')) == 'ios'">
  <PackageReference Include="AdamE.Firebase.iOS.Core" Version="12.10.0" />
</ItemGroup>
```

Use the equivalent `maccatalyst` condition for Mac Catalyst targets.

### Windows and Visual Studio users should expect long-path limitations

These packages include native xcframework contents, which can create very long file paths once NuGet expands them locally. On Windows and in Visual Studio, that can surface as restore failures, build failures, or archive failures.

If you hit errors such as `Could not find a part of the path...` or `Could not find or use auto-linked framework...`, the usual recovery steps are:

1. Enable Windows long-path support.
2. Close Visual Studio.
3. Clear the NuGet cache and the local Xamarin build download cache.
4. Run `dotnet restore` and `dotnet build` from the CLI first.
5. Reopen Visual Studio.

Archiving can still be more reliable on macOS or from the command line.

## Package status

The lists below reflect what is currently published on [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/adamessenmacher) under the `adamessenmacher` owner profile. That is intentionally different from the repo state in [`components.cake`](components.cake): the repo can contain projects or version bumps that have not been published yet.

Firebase `12.10.0` is the current published Firebase package line.

### Present in the repo, but not currently published on nuget.org

These projects exist in this repository, but I could not confirm current nuget.org packages for them under the `AdamE.*` package names:

- `AdamE.Google.iOS.Analytics`, `Cast`, `TagManager`, and `UserMessagingPlatform` are present in `source/`, but are not listed in the current nuget.org package set.
- `AdamE.MLKit.iOS.DigitalInkRecognition`, `FaceDetection`, `ImageLabeling`, and `ObjectDetection` are present in `source/` at `1.5.0`, but are not currently published on nuget.org.
- `AdamE.MLKit.iOS.TextRecognition`, `TextRecognition.Chinese`, `TextRecognition.Devanagari`, `TextRecognition.Japanese`, and `TextRecognition.Korean` are present in `source/` at `1.0.0.3`, but are not currently published on nuget.org.
- `AdamE.MLKit.iOS.TextRecognition.Latin` is present in `source/` at `1.4.0.3`, but is not currently published on nuget.org.
- `AdamE.MLKit.iOS.Vision` is present in `source/` at `3.0.0`, but is not currently published on nuget.org.

## Troubleshooting

### Duplicate native dependency conflicts

Google, Firebase, and ML Kit SDKs share native xcframework dependencies. Avoid mixing these packages with other independent binding libraries that ship their own copies of the same native Google/Firebase frameworks, or you can end up with duplicate symbols, linker failures, or runtime issues.

In practice, it is safest to make sure all Google/Firebase/ML Kit dependencies in an app come from one compatible binding set.

### Windows / Visual Studio restore and archive failures

If you see errors like `Could not find a part of the path...`, `Could not find or use auto-linked framework...`, or inconsistent archive behavior on Windows, start with the long-path recovery steps in the installation notes above. In most cases, the issue is not the package itself; it is the path length limit in the Windows/Visual Studio toolchain.

### Builds hanging in multi-targeted projects

If a project targets Android, Windows, or other non-Apple TFMs, do not place these package references in an unconditional `ItemGroup`. Condition them so they only apply to the iOS or Mac Catalyst targets.

### 7-zip extraction issues

If package extraction appears to be failing on Windows, see [this issue comment](https://github.com/AdamEssenmacher/GoogleApisForiOSComponents/issues/21#issuecomment-2172949175).

## Contributing and support

Pull requests are welcome, especially for stale bindings, dependency updates, docs improvements, and build fixes. For anything non-trivial, please open an issue or discussion first so we can align on the approach before you spend time on build tooling or binding surface changes.
